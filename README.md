# <img src="assets/icon.png"> Slimeform - the game!
Not much here right now, but this is the public issue tracker and feature request
repo for my in-development game Slimeform, which is a 2D platformer centred around
user-made levels and Addons.

## Discord Server
If you're interested in the game - and you probably aren't too impressed by this barebones repo as of
right now, but regardless - we have a **[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/BYwX3WdYSh)** to discuss the game,
and generally hang out!

Slimeform is far from ready for a public release and whether it'll even be seen through to completion is up for debate, but there is ongoing alpha testing open to anyone interested in the game and wanting to try it
out and give feedback.

## Libraries used by Slimeform!

These libraries have saved me a *whole* lot of time, and the project wouldn't be where it is
without them.
